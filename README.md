Hi,
I'm Subhraneel Haldar
 I make random things, mostly using JavaScript. üìå
 
 I lovee ‚ù§Ô∏è open-source! On my GitHub, 
 You will find various Websites made using HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT and other (mostly) JavaScript-based projects.
 
üî•üî• Have a look at [My Portfolio]( https://subhraneel77.github.io/Subhro7/) and contact me from there! üî•üî•

I developed a passion for programming and android development in my freshman year. My programming languages of choice are C/C++/python. I have had experience in working with large codebases as well as making something from scratch through previous works. Algorithms and Computer Architecture have been two of my favourite subjects in the college curriculum. I have a strong hold on Data Structures and Algorithms.

I believe I am the right choice for this project and will work on this full time over the summer. I will give weekly updates about my progress and ensure I deliver according to the timeline set. The project requires being efficient in C/C++ and Python, all of which I have been using for about 2 years now.

I am currently working in a Responsive Sumiffyy Website making under SmartIndian Hackathon using Html,Css,Javascript,React,Python  etc. I  try to build  new android applications as well as websites from scratch so i am familiar with large code base and project management. I am also familiar with nodejs, angular , express so i can also help making apis for the project if needed.The Urge of learning something new always drives me crazy.

For the past 3 months, I have been working on Ruby on Rails framework and JavaScript at CircuitVerse and developed an adequate interest in this.

Some of my other relevant achievements are :-

‚Ä¢	GoogleCloudReady Facilitator Program Contributor ‚Äî Worked as well as learned & practised concepts like Computing, Application Development, Big Data & Machine Learning using cloud.
‚Ä¢	Rank 2th out of 50 teams in TechFest 2022 at my University.
‚Ä¢	Got Selected as a Prime Member of Google Developer Students Club at my College.
‚Ä¢	Got selected to work as a Research Analyst at my College under the Overlapped Network Management.
